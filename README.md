# RemarkableBecause
Our website for #IAmRemarkable for Google CSSI 2019



## About the Project 💻
The site is inspired by Google's <a href = "https://iamremarkable.withgoogle.com/"> #IAmRemarkable initiative </a> which aims employers to do self-promotion. 

<strong> How it works: </strong>
* User logs in through their GMAIL account for a personal experience
* They have access to the <i> #IAmRemarkable tab </i>💫 where they are prompted to enter why they are remarkable 
* On the <i> calendar tab </i>, the user can view what they entered on a specific date 📅
* The user has access to a <i> Diary entry page </i>, as well as randomly generated motivational quotes.
* Finally the user may find helpful information on the <i> resources page and help page </i>
