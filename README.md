# RemarkableBecause
Our website for #IAmRemarkable for Google CSSI 2019

## About the Project 💻
The site is inspired by Google's <a href = "https://iamremarkable.withgoogle.com/"> #IAmRemarkable initiative </a> which aims employers to do self-promotion. 

How it works:
* User logs in through their GMAIL account for a personal experience
* They have access to the #I am Remarkable tab where they are prompted to enter why they are remarkable 
* On the Calendar tab, the user can view what they entered on a specific date
* The user has access to a Diary entry page, as well as randomly generated motivational quotes. 
- [] Finally the user may find helpful information on the resources page and help page

## Tools 🛠️
Google App Engine, AJAX + Datastore, Healthruwords API, HTML/CSS, and Python
